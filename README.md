# Jekyll Environment for My Academic Website

This repository contains the Jekyll environment, which is used to automatically generate my personal academic website hosted on github pages ([link](mootutu.github.io)).

## Publication List

Publications are defined in `_data/publications.yml` and rendered on the homepages (`index.html` and `cn/index.html`) via a shared include. Add BibTeX files under `assets/bibtex/` and reference them in the data file using the `bib` field.
